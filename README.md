# nfl-rest-scraper
This repo is for a final project in Dr. Michelle Levine's COMS4995 - Empirical Methods of Data Science Course at Columbia University. It includes the code we used to build our web scrapers as well as the datasets they produced.

We have structured our work in three separate directories—bye_weeks, distance, and tnf—based on the different datasets we are analyzing. More details on each dataset can be found below.

## Bye Weeks
